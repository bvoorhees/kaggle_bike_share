##Description
This dataset is a transformed version of merged test, train (activity), and subject data from the UCI HAR dataset described above. The data are a *subset* of the full original dataset, taking the means of the standard deviation and mean measurements over each subject and subject's activity. **Hence, each row in `tidy_data_means.txt` represents an observation of each subsetted feature's mean for each subject and the activity that subject performed for the test.**  
  
*I reccomend you to view the original readme file from the original dataset https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip*

##The dataset includes the following files:

- `README.txt`

- `run_analysis.R` - An R script that 1) assembles data from the original UCI HAR dataset; 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement; 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set; 4 )Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names; 5) From the data set in 4), creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

- `tidy_data_means.txt`: Dataset created from `run_analysis.R`- i.e. the means of the standard deviations and means from the original dataset by test subject and the test subject's activity.

- `Codebook.Rmd` - An explanation of each of the features in the `tidy_data_means.txt`


##SUMMARY OF ORIGINAL DATASET FROM THE MAKERS 
>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.   

>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.  

>**For each record it is provided:**  

>- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
>- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
>- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
>- Its activity label. 
>- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

>**Notes:**   

>- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
>- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
